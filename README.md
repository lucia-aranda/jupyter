## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, you need a development environment installed on your machine:

- `Jupyter Notebook (or any other similar application)`

And internet conection 🌐 to propertly load libraries.

## Installation

To install it, run the next command:

```
X
```

## Concept

This is a responsive javascript portfolio using mathematical exercises with recursivity, arrays, selection, including while, do while, and for loops. Showcases fundamental programming logic and control flow structures with practical, executable examples. 🧮

It combines JavaScript animations, CSS styling, Bootstrap and modern front-end techniques to create an engaging user experience. The project features interactive hover effects, and minimalist design that enhance visual simplicity. With clean code structure, the project demonstrates both technical skills like JavaScript DOM manipulation, alongside strong design sensibility through responsive layouts and user-friendly navigation. 👩‍💻

Whether you're a developer interested in seeing clean implementations of fundamental programming patterns, or someone curious about how code can tackle mathematical puzzles, this portfolio offers hands-on examples that are both educational and engaging. Each exercise is designed to make complex computational logic accessible and visual. 📔
